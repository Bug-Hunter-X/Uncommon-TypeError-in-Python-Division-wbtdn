# Uncommon TypeError in Python Division

This repository demonstrates a less frequently encountered error in Python: a TypeError during division.  Standard division by zero is common, but attempting division with incompatible data types is less obvious.

The `bug.py` file shows the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.py` offers potential solutions including input validation to prevent the TypeError from happening.
